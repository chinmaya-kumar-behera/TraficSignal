            <Paragraph>
                Urban planning is the process of designing and managing the growth
                of urban areas. It involves the creation of plans for the development
                and use of land, transportation systems, public facilities, and services
                such as water supply, waste management, and energy distribution.
                Finding the right balance in city planning is important.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The main objective of urban planning is to create a livable
                environment in which people can work and live. This requires
                balancing the needs of different groups such as residents, businesses,
                commuters, and tourists.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph> In order to plan effectively, cities need accurate data on population
                size, demographics, employment trends, economic conditions etc.
                Cities also need to understand how people move around within them.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
                This is where technologies like AI and machine learning come in.
                They can help cities collect data more efficiently and analyze it faster.
                This helps planners make better decisions about how to allocate
                resources.

            <Heading> Autonomous Vehicle.
            </Heading>

            <Paragraph>An autonomous vehicle is an important part of artificial intelligence
                in transportation. The operation of an autonomous vehicle is taken
                over completely or partly by the vehicle itself. Autonomous vehicles
                can also be called “self-driving vehicle”. There are so many
                advantages of using autonomous vehicles on roads. According to
                transportation engineers, these are the advantages of using them.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
                Introduction of autonomous vehicles on highways, freeways and
                road intersections will reduce traffic congestion by at least 50%.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph> Autonomous vehicles can quickly avoid accidents on the road than a
                human driver due to their computational intelligence</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph> When the level of congestion is low, the speed of autonomous
                vehicles will also reduce. Moreover, due to their speed, efficiency and
                speed control mechanisms, autonomous vehicles will improve its
                energy efficiency by 20%.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Autonomous vehicles also provide a good traveling experience.
                All the advantages stated above should be enough reasons why autonomous vehicles should be introduced on the highways. Although
                all the advantages are as a result of researches and theoretical studies
                that have been carried out on autonomous vehicles. Just by looking at the difference between real-life situations and modeling of systems
                which are related to autonomous vehicles. It is quite hard to
                understand the relationship between traffic congestion and
                autonomous vehicles. A lot of factors will dictate the compatibility of
                autonomous vehicles on the roads. Therefore, understanding the effect
                that autonomous vehicles have on real-life scenario will go a long
                way in helping researchers understand why the application of artificial
                intelligence is important in transportation networks. Although
                traffic rules and regulations for controlling traffic flow at intersections
                have been implemented in so many developed countries by their
                respective governments, the evaluation and analysis of various
                strategies at real-life locations is not easy due to different issues such
                as legal restrictions, user acceptance, availability of unlimited
                possibilities, non-limitations of the controllers and financial
                constraints.</Paragraph>

            <Heading>Effect of Artificial Intelligence on Traffic congestion.
            </Heading>
            <Paragraph> Traffic congestion is one of the most well-known road transportation
                problems in major urban cities all over the world. It is common in
                every countries of the world, either underdeveloped, developing or
                developed countries, it is even more pronounced in developing
                countries, and developed countries such as United States of America,
                United Kingdom, and China. China have an all-time high number of
                traffic congestion in their major cities. Over the years, Transportation
                engineers have tried to reduce or eradicate traffic congestion in urban
                areas by constructing more roads and repairing loopholes on
                highways and introducing road intersections, but these measures have
                done little or nothing in curbing these problems</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>The rapid increase of developments in artificial intelligence has been
                providing unlimited opportunities to improve the efficiency of various
                types of industries and businesses, mostly in the transportation sector.
                Artificial Intelligence introduced some innovations such as advanced
                computational intelligence. Computational intelligence is a process
                that works or mimic the way the human brain works.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>There are a lot of challenges facing the transportation sector, but the
                application of artificial intelligence has gone a long way in reducing
                these challenges, the most prominent among these challenges are</Paragraph>

            <Heading style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}> Advantages of Intelligent Traffic Systems
            </Heading>

            <Paragraph> There are many advantages associated with the implementation of
                these systems, which will be clearly clarified as follows.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Improved Traffic Management: One of the key advantages of
                implementing Intelligent Traffic Systems is the potential for improved
                traffic management. These systems provide a real-time overview of
                traffic conditions, enabling authorities to take necessary actions to
                alleviate congestion. For instance, by adjusting the timing of traffic
                signals based on traffic flow, ITS can improve the efficiency of road
                usage and reduce travel time. This management extends beyond daily
                traffic control, assisting in the coordination of road maintenance and
                construction work to minimize disruption to the general public.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph> Enhanced Safety: Another significant advantage is enhanced safety
                for both drivers and pedestrians. ITS technologies can detect potential
                hazards and incidents, providing timely warnings to drivers. For
                example, systems can alert drivers about upcoming congestion or road
                work, allowing them to adjust their speed or plan alternate routes.
                Moreover, smart pedestrian crossing systems play a crucial role in
                protecting pedestrian safety by syncing with traffic signals, ensuring
                safer street crossing periods.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Increased Efficiency in Fuel Consumption: Intelligent Traffic Systems
                can also lead to increased efficiency in fuel consumption. By
                optimizing traffic flow, ITS can reduce the time vehicles spend idling
                in traffic or searching for parking. This reduction in unnecessary
                vehicle movement can result in substantial fuel savings, contributing
                to lower operating costs for drivers and transport companies.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Environmental Benefits: Lastly, ITS can contribute to environmental
                sustainability. The reduction in traffic congestion and improved fuel
                efficiency leads to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions.
                Furthermore, ITS technologies like electronic toll collection and smart
                parking systems reduce the need for physical infrastructure, leading to
                less land usage and disruption of natural ecosystems. This way,
                Intelligent Traffic Systems can play a pivotal role in supporting
                sustainable urban development.</Paragraph>

            <Heading style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}> Disadvantages of Intelligent Traffic Systems
            </Heading>

            <Paragraph>Despite the numerous advantages, the implementation of Intelligent
                Traffic Systems is not without its drawbacks. Here are some of the
                challenges associated with ITS:</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>High Implementation and Maintenance Costs: The initial cost of
                implementing ITS can be quite high. This includes the cost of
                installing sensors, cameras, data processing centers, and other
                necessary infrastructure. Additionally, maintaining these systems can
                also be expensive due to the need for regular system upgrades,
                replacements, and repairs. These costs can pose a significant financial
                burden, especially for cities with limited budgets.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Reliability and Technical Issues: Like any digital system, ITS are also
                susceptible to technical glitches and malfunctions. The reliability of
                these systems is heavily dependent on the proper functioning of all
                their components. A single failing sensor or a glitch in the data
                processing software can lead to incorrect traffic management
                decisions, potentially causing chaos on the roads.</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>Privacy Concerns: The use of cameras and sensors for data collection
                in ITS has raised concerns over privacy. These systems continuously
                monitor and record the movement of vehicles and pedestrians, leading
                to potential misuse of personal data. Ensuring the privacy of
                individuals while utilizing ITS technologies remains a significant
                challenge in their deployment and acceptance.</Paragraph>

            <Heading>Conclusion</Heading>

            <Paragraph>In this paper, an artificial neural network for prediction of traffic
                congestion of non-autonomous vehicles at signalized road intersection
                has been presented. The results clearly show that the ANN model was
                able to predict the traffic flow of vehicles efficiently considering
                vehicle speed and class description. To effectively predict the traffic
                flow of vehicles ten minutes into the future, it is imperative to have a
                large datasets.Ann will handle complex problem with non
                deterministic inputs and large dateset. The limitation of this research
                is the inability to gain access to robust dateset. With the shift from
                current revolution to the Fourth Industrial Revolution researchers are
                hopeful to to conduct future research focusing on autonomous
                vehicles at UN-signalized road intersections and application of big
                data analytic at road intersections.</Paragraph>
